# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview
We are going to create an analysis for your clients who are preparing to get into the cryptocurrency market. We are going create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.



The datais not ideal, so it will need to be processed to fit the machine learning models. Since there is no known output for what we are looking for, we'll use unsupervised learning. To group the cryptocurrencies, we'll use a clustering algorithm. Weâ€™ll use data visualizations to share her findings with the board.
